## Introduction

The Photo Gallery Application is a web-based platform that allows administrators to manage photo galleries and provide access to viewers using unique access codes. Viewers can browse photos and select them for printing.

## Accessing the Application

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the application URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
2. You will be presented with a login screen.

## Admin Dashboard

### Managing Access Codes

1. Log in with your admin credentials.
2. In the "Manage Access Codes" section, enter the required information:
   - Email
   - Full Name
   - New Access Code
   - Role (Viewer or Admin)
3. Click "Create Access Code" to generate a new access code.

### Uploading Photos

1. In the "Upload Photos" section of the Admin Dashboard, you'll see a search bar labeled "Search Access Code or Email".
2. Start typing the access code or email associated with the gallery you want to upload photos to.
3. As you type, a list of matching access codes will appear. Click on the correct access code to select it.
4. You'll see a confirmation message showing the selected access code.
5. Click the "Select Photos" button to open your computer's file browser.
6. Select up to 100 photos that you want to upload. You can select multiple photos at once.
7. After selecting the photos, you'll see a message indicating how many files you've selected.
